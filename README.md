## README

Notes on both languages and (development) tools I have encountered. Making notes for my sake and for others.

`languages/` contains notes on the syntax and main features of a given programming language, whilst `tools/` contains useful platforms and supporting techniques to make programming easier.

These notes are simply made to enable ME to learn, rather than as a concrete teaching resource etc.. Some of my notes are completely out of date and wrong BUT served the purpose of being stepping stones to a greater understanding
