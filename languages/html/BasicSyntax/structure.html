<!-- When you create html pages it is important to structure them correctly -->


<!doctype html> <!-- tells browser the file is formatted as HTML5 -->

<html lang="en"> <!-- root element; all others must sit inside this (like c++ curly brackets) -->
<!-- contains attributes such as 'lang', indicating content is written in english -->
	<head> <!-- contains hidden information used by browser to understand the page -->
  <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- stores metadata relating to page -->

  <title>My Cool Webpage</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The simplest possible web page">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
</head>

<body> <!-- contains the information to be displayed in the browser window -->
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p>Content goes here...</p>
</body>
</html>
