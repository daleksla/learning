  <h1>Description Lists</h1>
  
  <p>A description list is a list of items with a description or definition
    of each item.</p>
  
  <h2>Computer Memory</h2>
  
  <p>There are two types of memory:</p>

  <dl> <!-- tag to indcate description list-->
    <dt>RAM</dt> <!-- description term -->
    <dd>Random access memory. The memory usable by programs. The amount was
    typically in the ballpark of 20 to 64 kilobytes. However, the Basic
    interpreter by default consumed a part of this.</dd> <!-- the description itself -->

    <dt>ROM</dt>
    <dd>Read-only memory. This was normally smaller in size than RAM and
    roughly corresponded to the hardware implementation of the operating
    system.</dd>
  </dl>
