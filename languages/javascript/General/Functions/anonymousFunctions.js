/* In JavaScript, functions are a data type (like strings and numbers) that can be assigned to variables
 * Because we are assigning the function to a variable we donâ€™t give it a name directly
	 * This is known as defining an anonymous function, using the function keyword in place of the function name
	 * Anonymous functions are used heavily in JavaScript */
