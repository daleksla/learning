/* Due to the limitations associated with promises, async functions werre developed as an alternate syntax
 * The changes to the syntax allow you to create promise chains by writing code thatâ€™s as easy to read and debug as standard synchronous code
 * It simply allows us to write promise-like code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread
 * Async functions will always return a value
	 * It makes sure that a promise is returned
	 * If it is not returned then javascript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value 
 * The await operator is used to wait for a Promise
	 * It can only be used inside an async function*/
