/* Smart pointers: they automatically deallocate memory when not pointing at an address 
 * Wrapper around raw pointers
 * Donâ€™t need to remember to delete & therefore no memory leaks
 * They have 99% of the same functionality as normal pointers 
 * Three types : shared_ptr, unique_ptr, weak_ptr
	 * shared_ptr - retains shared ownership of an object through a pointer
	 * unique_ptr - just like shared_ptr, but only one of these types can point to one object
	 * weak_ptr - isn't bloody needed rn */
