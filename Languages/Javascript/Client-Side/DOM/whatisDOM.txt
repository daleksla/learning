/* We use client-side JavaScript to interact with contents of a webpage
	 * e.g. hide or show content, apply different styles, etc.
 * Our JS code, to do so, must be able to reference our HTML file
	 * The Document Object Model (DOM) is used for this very purpose - to allow us to interacts with the contents of the webpage
 * Each html element is represented by a single DOM node
	 * Therefore, we can use JavaScript to modify the DOM and thus change the content and appearance of your web pages
