 * The Ava testing tools is what we should use - it supports ES6 modules easily as well as having a simple syntax
	 * You will need to install ava using the command 'npm' (like all installations of external modules), as well as the subcommand 'init ava'
	 * You will also need to regularly install the 'esm' package (this will recognise ES6 modules)
		 * Note: there needs to be an ava section in the package manifest to tell it to use the esm package
			 * e.g. "ava": {
					  "verbose": true, //the 'verbose' flag tells the tool to list each test whether it has passed or failed
					  "require": [ //the 'require' flag imports the esm package
						"esm"
					  ]
					 }
