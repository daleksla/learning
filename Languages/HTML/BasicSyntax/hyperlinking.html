<p>Example#1: Find out about the courses that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coventry.ac.uk">Coventry University</a> offers.</p>
<p>Example#2: <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN</a></p>
<!-- <a> creates the hyperlink on what it surrounds (e.g. text)-->
<!-- note: the attributes must be stored within the opening tag (e.g. <a yadada yadayadada> hyperlink-text-here </a>)
<!-- 'attributes'  are used to provide additional information about html elements -->
<!-- 'href' is a type of attribute, 'href' being the name storing the value, stored in double quotes (the link)-->
<!-- 'target' is another ; when set to "_blank", the link is opened in a new tab-->

<h2 id="beginnings">Coventry's beginnings in the Forest of Arden</h2>
<a href="#beginnings">Coventry's beginnings in the Forest of Arden</a>

<!-- We can also hyperlink to parts of the same page - first we must create an anchor where the hyperlink will lead to ; in this example we add an attribute to the <h2> tag called 'id' -->
<!-- We then source the link in the <a>'s 'href' attribute as the id attribute we just made -->
