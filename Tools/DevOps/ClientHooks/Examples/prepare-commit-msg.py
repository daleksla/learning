		* Separate subject from body with a blank line
		* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
		* Capitalize the subject line
		* Do not end the subject line with a period
		* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
		* Wrap the body at 72 characters
		* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how 
	* We can prompt the user in the intial template to follow these steps"""
