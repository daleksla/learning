""" * When the commit command is triggered, this program will be called
	* By default, the second parameter will be a link to the temporary file where the commit's message is stored
		* We can read through this file to judge whether the message is appropriate or not 
		
	* A good commit message should obey the following rules:
		* Seperate subject from body with a blank line
		* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
		* Capitalise the subject line
		* Do not end the subject line with a period (ie '.')
		* Wrap text at 72 characters (don't let each line have more then 72 character) 
	* We can write to check these rules are being followed or to throw an error """
