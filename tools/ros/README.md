# ROS

ROS is a powerful tool / platform for writing controller code.
This folder contains example nodes (`./src`), custom messages (`./msg`) & custom services (`./srv`).
The `./launch` folder contains an example launch file that makes use of nodes & namespaces.
This folder is modeled on a catkin workspace (ie. the whole folder is compilable using `catkin_make`).
