# z3
## examples

This sub-folder demonstrates real-world usage of z3 and constraint programming generally, as opposed to the parent folder which simply shows how to use the specific z3 API.

Why? Because all the examples I've shown are very easy and don't show how to truly use constraint programming and the z3 solver tool. Other notes I take generally imply the real-world usage but this didn't, so now I specify its use case
