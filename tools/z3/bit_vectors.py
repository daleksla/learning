    * @brief File shows has z3 can manipute bit vectors

    * One of the most common applications of z3 is verification of software and hardware

    * Since CPU's perform arithmetic with bit-vectors of a fixed size, z3 supports this and has a constructor and functionality for such objects both unsigned and two's complement signed

    * Bit vector constructors
          * BitVecVal is the constructor for bit vectors where value is known
            * Takes two params:
                * #1 value to be stored in bit vector
                * #2 size of bit vector (16 bits, 32 bits, etc.)
         * BitVec is the constructor for bit vectors where value is known
            * Takes two params:
                * #1 a string (if contents are unknown)
                * #2 size of bit vector (16 bits, 32 bits, etc.)


    * Since there are no distinction is datatype between signed and unsigned bit vectors, Z3 provides different operators which correspond to the signedness
        * Signed operators: <, <=, >, >=, /, %, >>
        * Unsigned functions: ULT (larger than), ULE (less or equal to), UGT (greater than), UGE (greator or equal to), UDiv (division), URem (modulo), LShR (right shift)
        * Shared bit-wise boolean logic operators: & (and), | (or), ~ (not)
        * Also == and != are still valid
