    * @brief File shows how to create variables of different types in z3 and effects of such use when solving

    * To create variables:
        * Create single variable: <type>(<string_z3_should_refer_to_var_as>)
        * Create multiple variables of a given type: <type>s(<string_containing_space_seperated_names_z3_should_refer_to_vars_as)
            * Returns tuple of said objects
        * Convention to store output of these calls into variable of the same as what you told z3 to call said variable

    * Multiple different types in z3:

        * Bool, Int, Real, Array, List, Funnctions (see function_reasoning.py)
            * non-whole numbers and related calculating do not suffer inaccuracy
                * z3 internally uses fractions and other methods to precisely store values.
                * when printing, it is done in floating point format - the `?` at the end of the float flags this as just an approximation to the actual data
                * We can set precision of decimal output using the `set_option` *function* with the `precision` parameter set
                * furthermore, we can derive the actual expression using the .spexr() method on the z3 datatype
            * Note: since polynomial equations have solutions for rational and irrational->algebraic numbers ONLY, z3 does not values such as PI and e as these are irrational->transcendental values
            * Note: numbers such as âˆš2 are stored as 'root objects' when represented, storing a polynomial and a number showing which root we are talking about (as any number has two square roots)

        * Z3 requires us to specify the domains of our variables clearly - it affects what algorithms are run by Z3 and the subsequent results
            * e.g. if a problem can only be satisified with real numbers but the variable in the constraints were integers, solver would still fail as you specified you want integers as part of the constraint
